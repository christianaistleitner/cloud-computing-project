## Abstract

This project is an assignment for the course 510.211 Special Topics - Cloud Computing (2021W), held at the Johannes Kepler University, Linz.
It aims for gaining additional hands-on experience and therefore, we concentrate on implementing our own CD pipeline. 
Therefore, we are going to use the tool Tekton for implementing the CD pipeline, being able to deploy artifacts in a dev and production branch.
